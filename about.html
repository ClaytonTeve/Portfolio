				<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
				<p>While most of the classes for my Graphic Design focused on designing for print almost all of the classes focuses heavily on marketing. I was thought how to appeal to consumers and build trust in the almighty brand. To keep a full time schedule I wound up taking a lot of elective classes as well. This left me with a laundry list of areas of study. In a nutshell I would say my three years earning my associate degree gave me these skills:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Branding / Identity</li>
					<li>Marketing / Advertising</li>
					<li>Typographic Design</li>
					<li>3d Modeling</li>
					<li>Video Editing</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Frontend Web Development</h3>
				<p>It has been a busy year for me learning to code. The journey started with the desire to make myself more marketable as a designer, for every person that needed a logo about 80% wanted a website (and 100% needed one). So I made the decision to sit down and learn to code, to be a better designer, but then something happened. I found out programing is awesome. Finally my technically inclined brain that always wants to make stuff work and my creative brain that wants to make the same stuff speak got together and had somewhere to spend their energy. I am still very new to it but I spend every single day learning something new. I am filled with excitement for all there is to learn out. There is a world being built and I want to play a part in its creation. My current training:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Treehouse: Frontend Developer Track | Compleated</li>
					<li>Code Oregon 1.0 | Compleated</li>
					<li>Elequent JavaScript - Marijn Haverbeke | Read
					<li>Codecademy Pro/ Fullstack Track | Current Course</li>
